Here, we summarized the data, code, and necessary documents. We used Matlab and Python as our tools, and the code were integrated into three parts as “1_Trajectory_estimation”, “2_PageRank”, and “3_word_embedding” for ease of use. 
The order for code running:
1. “1_Trajectory_estimation” Folder: Part_1.py---Part_2_Main_paths_estiamtion.py;
2. “2_PageRank” Folder: 1_geo2cellid---2_cellid2node.py---3_PageRank.m---4_getstopovers.py;
3. “3_word_embedding”Folder: 5_getdocuments.py---6_getvectors.py.
